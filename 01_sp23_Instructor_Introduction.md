## A little about me.

I am Naga Vemprala. I am an assistant professor teaching in the business
school at the University of Portland. I received my Ph.D. in Information
Technology from the University of Texas at San Antonio. Using data
analytics to examine social media users’ actions and responses during
times of crisis is one of my primary research interests. I use Twitter
tweets and other social media-related data to conduct my research and
find answers to research questions concerning user responses to crisis
occurrences. One of my other lines of research has involved analyzing
the text reviews posted on e-commerce websites by product users
(customers) to ascertain the features of a product that are most
significant to those customers. In addition, I use cutting-edge
blockchain technology in my research to develop prototypes for
government and commercial usage, with the aim of fostering greater
transparency and trust.

### Here intentionally a smaller header is used. **Course objectives.**

-   First, let me use bullet points to explain them here
    -   this is a sub-bullet point
-   During the first two classes, students are exposed to the R
    eco-system, variables, R built-in functions, user-defined functions,
    and the use of variables created by students within user-defined
    functions
-   Then, the students will learn how to utilize the robust ggplot2
    library to generate a variety of fascinating and frequently used
    graphs  
-   R is the industry standard for statistical analysis and a fantastic
    tool for data scientists. The initial step of a data science project
    is to identify the problem or formulate a question, followed by the
    collection of data to answer the question. Once the data has been
    read, confirm that it is authentic and determine the relationship
    between the variables (outcome of the exploratory analysis)
-   The next several classes will concentrate on the essential features
    of major packages like tidyverse, dplyr, and readr
-   Important probability distributions for data analysis will be
    introduced
-   Working with many different types of data, including text data and
    web data in the form of JSON files
-   Object-oriented programming will be presented, followed by
    time-series data - Throughout the course, students will be
    introduced to numerous commercial applications and will be required
    to submit a variety of projects

**The below table shows some important packages and the functions of
those packages**

**Cheatsheets are available for each of these packages. Test them once
and get familiarize with the functionality. Then the cheatsheet will be
much more helpful.**
