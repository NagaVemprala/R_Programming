## The questions in this markdown must be answered using the tidyr and dplyr packages' functions. 
#### The tidyverse functionality is greatly enhanced using the pipes (%>% from magrittr)
#### Load the required packages before starting the assignment. 
#### Questions 1 through 11 are related to tidyr (with one exception of using a base function - "replace")
#### Questions 12 through 11 are related to tidyr (with one exception of using a base function - "replace")

# Use inner_join to join superheroes and publishers on publisher column.
superheroes %>%
  inner_join(publishers)

# Use semi_join to join superheroes and publishers on publisher column.
superheroes %>%
  semi_join(publishers)
# What is the difference between these two types of joins? 
#ANSWER:
#inner_join() is taking the yr_founded also in the answer but the semi_join() is ignoring the yr_founded in the final result
# Just like a left join in SQL 

```


```{r Q13. Filter rows by one or more column conditions}

#### The scoped variants of mutate() and transmute() make it easy to apply the same transformation to multiple variables. There are three variants:

- _all affects every variable    

- _at affects variables selected with a character vector or vars()    

- _if affects variables selected with a predicate function:    
``` {r Q16. using mutate_at add $10 to the price}
# using mutate_at add $10 to the price

# mutate_at(.tbl, .vars, .funs, ..., .cols = NULL)

diamonds %>% 
  mutate_at(.vars = c("price"), 
            .funs = increment_10)

diamonds %>% 
  mutate_at(.vars = c("price"), 
            .funs = function(x) x + 10)

diamonds %>% 
  mutate_at(.vars = c("price", "depth"), 
            .funs = function(x) x + 10)

diamonds %>% 
  mutate_at(.vars = c("price"), 
            .funs = list(new_price = function(x) x + 10))

```


``` {r Q17. Use mutate across to add $10 to the price}
# using mutate across, add $10 to the price. mutate across is the preferred method. 
# use mutate(across( .. rest all should be the same
# mutate(across(.cols = everything(), .fns = NULL, ..., .names = NULL)
