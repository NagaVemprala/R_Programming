## Most common formats in HTML are shown in this document  

This markdown's output format is set to github_document so that all the details are nicely displayed on the github page. R markdown, on the other hand, can generate output in a variety of formats. For example, if a PDF output is required, using pdf_document will suffice.

#### Lets first display an image.

#### The code below displays a bulleted list with sub-bullets under some items.

*   This markdown is part of the R learning experience (Introductory concepts)

*   By following the steps below, anyone can become a data scientist who can assist businesses in making sound decisions.

    * First, learn R. 

    * You could easily switch to Python later
    
*   R provides students with a wide range of opportunities
    

The code below displays a numbered list.

1.  Item 2. The numbers are incremented automatically in the output.
2.  Item 3. Look at some of the requirements that employers post in their job postings. 

#### Demonstrating how to use italics. Do you want to know what Martin Luther King Jr. said about education? 

*The function of education, therefore, is to teach one to think intensively and to think critically. But education which stops with efficiency may prove the greatest menace to society. The most dangerous criminal may be the man gifted with reason, but with no morals. "We must remember that intelligence is not enough,” King advised. “Intelligence plus character — that is the goal of true education."*

#### Demonstrating how to use some bold words. Again from the words of King. Jr
*"We must remember that intelligence is not enough,” King advised.* **“Intelligence plus character** *— that is the goal of true education."*

#### Demonstrating how to use headers.   
#### Headers are used throughout this markdown file. 
# Some of the headers are BIGGGGG!
## Some of the headers are MEDIUM!
### Some of the headers are SMALL!
#### Some of the headers are extra small!

#### You can show the results without showing the code using R markdown. For example, show the summary of iris dataset 
```{r summary_iris, echo= FALSE}
summary(iris)
```

#### Nice tables can be easily created with R markdown. Here is a 3x3 table 

Level         | AWS           | Google       |
------------- | ------------- | ------------ |
Foundation  | Certified Cloud Practitioner  | Cloud Digital Leader |
Associate level  | AWS Certified Developer   | Associate Cloud Engineer |
Professional level  | Certified Solutions Architect  | Professional Cloud Developer |

#### Including nice plots. This time the code to generate the plot is also shown. 

```{r pressure, echo=TRUE}
plot(pressure)
```


#### Lastly, the session info is displayed here. 

```{r session}
sessionInfo()
```
